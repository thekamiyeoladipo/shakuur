                    Located in the Andes, near the city of Cusco, these mountains are famous 
                    for their vibrant, multicolored stripes, which are the result of sedimentary 
                    mineral layers exposed over millions of years. The colors range from deep reds

                    It is best known for its towering natural arch, known as the 
                    "Heavenâ€™s Gate," a massive hole in the rock that rises over

                <h2 class="section-heading">Whitehaven Beach, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º</h2>
                <p>
                    Whitehaven Beach, located in the Whitsunday Islands of Australia, 
                    is often considered one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. 
                    The beach is known for its pure white silica sand, which is so fine 
                    that it feels like powder underfoot. The turquoise waters of the Coral
                     Sea provide a stunning contrast to the white sand, creating a picture-perfect 
                     paradise. Whitehaven Beach is part of a protected national park, ensuring that 
                     its natural beauty remains unspoiled. Visitors can explore the beach by boat, 
                     and the nearby Hill Inlet offers panoramic views that are simply breathtaking
